# FPGA_ESP_WIFI
This project contains two parts of code,one is FPGA part,the other is ESP8266.The devices used are ep4ce6 series of Altera and esp-01s of espressif,The function of the implementation is to let FPGA control the other four ESPs through an ESP, in which one is the host and the other four are the slaves, and they communicate with each other through TCP.
